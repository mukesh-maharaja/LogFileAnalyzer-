## Example Usage üéØ

### Sample Log File (`logs.log`):
```
2024-11-19 10:15:32 ERROR Failed to connect to the database.
2024-11-19 10:16:12 INFO  Connection established successfully.
2024-11-19 10:18:45 WARNING Disk space running low.
2024-11-19 10:20:00 ERROR Application crashed unexpectedly.
```

### Commands:
**Filter by Severity**:
```bash
java LogFileAnalyzer --filter ERROR
```

**Generate Report**:
```bash
java LogFileAnalyzer --generate-report logs.log
```

**Export Report**:
```bash
java LogFileAnalyzer --export logs_report.csv
```

## Implementation Details ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Multithreading**:
   - Log parsing and analysis are handled in separate threads to improve performance for large files.

2. **Log Parsing**:
   - Uses regular expressions to extract date, severity, and message fields.
   - Supports Log4j patterns like `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS [SEVERITY] Message`.

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Summarizes the frequency of events like errors or warnings.
   - Customizable to include additional metrics.

4. **File Handling**:
   - Supports uploading multiple files sequentially or in batches.
